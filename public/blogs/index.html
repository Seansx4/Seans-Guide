          <p>
            Our dog boarding kennels were first built in 1994. Our Kennels were
            built so that each of our dog kennels are provided with an
            individual sleeping and feeding enclosure. Each Kennel is cleaned
            and disinfected daily. There is access to water at all times and
            food is prepared and given as per owner's instructions.We also offer
            a freezer facility for fresh and cooked meats.
          </p>
          <p>
            We supply high quality dry and canned food. If the dog is on
            prescription or specialised food eg. Science Plan, Royal Canin, the
            owner should supply this.
